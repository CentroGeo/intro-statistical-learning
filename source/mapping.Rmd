## Introduction

In this workshop we are going to do a simple mapping excercise using R. Although we will not carry on any analysis, we will produce a simple map and plot some variables, the idea is to get you acquanted with the basic tools to handle geospatial datain R.

Before we start, lets install all the required packages

```{r}
install.packages(c("sp", "rgdal", "ggmap", "rgeos", "maptools"))
```

* ´sp´ handles spatial dataframes
* ´rgdal´ handles geospatial datasources and projections
* ´ggmap´ is like ´ggplot´ but for maps
* ´rgeos´ is a tool that lets us build and operate on geometric objects
* ´maptools´ provides a set of tools to draw better maps

## Loading data

For this workshop we will use bike sharing data from London, the data comes as a csv with coordinates as columns.

```{r}
cycle <- read.csv("../data/London_cycle_hire_locs.csv", header = TRUE)
cycle
```
