## [Introduction to Statistical Learning with R](https://centrogeo.github.io/intro-statistical-learning/)


The aim of this course is to give an overview of some of the most important concepts and tools behind Statistical Learning, and at the same time, introducing the students to the use of the [R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) for data analysis. The focus is on providing the students with an intuitive understanding of the possibilities and limitations of statistical data analysis, rather than a formal introduction to the mathematical background.

Although some knowledge of basic mathematics, statistics and programming would be valuable, the curse is designed to be self contained so no specifical background is required.

The topics treated where chosen as to provide the students with a broad overview of the tools (both mathematical and technological) and concepts of Statistical Learning and not as a comprehensive compendium. The idea is that although not every techinique and concept is covered, the topics treated shold provide the students with the necessary background to understand the data analysis process and work by themselves on their own projects.

### Requirements

You will nedd a computer with the latest distribution of R installed, you can find installers for different plataforms on the [R project homepage](https://www.r-project.org/)

Altough not strictly necessary, R-studio will help you in running and understanding the excercises. You can find installers for R-studio [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Course organization

The course is organized as a series of workshops. In each workshop we will cover a specific topic in data analysis while, at the same time, introduce the R packages and concepts related to it. The first two workshops are intended to be an introduction to R and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). From then on we will explore some of the basic tools and techinques as well as explore some of the limitations of data analysis.

Each workshop is contained in a notebook with the code and explanations necessary. Each notebook contains enough explanations so that the student can follow it on his own time.

### External Resources

* Some of the material and the general idea for the course is based on the excelent book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/)

* Another great resource more dedicated to R and the tidyverse is the online book by Hadley Wickham [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
